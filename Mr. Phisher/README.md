## Challenge Scenerio
I recieved a suspicious email with a very weird-looking attachment. It keeps asking me to "enable macros". What are those?

## Task 
Uncover the flag in the email attachment : {}

## Walkthrough
Opening the room, you're shown a folder directory containing both a word document an a zip file (inside the zip file is the same word document)

Opening the word document you're met with the alert from the scenerio.

Lets go see what all the fuss is about by viewing the macros ourselves.

If we break down each line of the code:
```vb
Option VBASupport 1
Sub Format() ' creates a sub procedure (executes a task - doesnt return any values - similar to a void function)'
Dim a() 'creates a list variable named "a"'
Dim b As String  'creates a string variable named "b"'

a = Array(102, 109, 99, 100, 127, 100, 53, 62, 105, 57, 61, 106, 62, 62, 55, 110, 113, 114, 118, 39, 36, 118, 47, 35, 32, 125, 34, 46, 46, 124, 43, 124, 25, 71, 26, 71, 21, 88)

For i = 0 To UBound(a) 'creates a for loop from 0 to 37 (the amount of elemens in a)'
b = b & Chr(a(i) Xor i) 'XORs the nummbers in the array getting the char value and adding it to b'

Next 'continuing'
End Sub 'endoffunction'
```

### Solving
Solving is a matter of finding out what b is 
To do this, I simply created a new document with macros. (You do this so we can isolate and control the code ourselves) 

Pasted in the original function and edited it to print out the b variable by adding this line before the 'End Sub' line.
```vb
Print b
```

You can execute the code using the green play button and you'll recieve the following alert containing the flag needed to complete the room.
